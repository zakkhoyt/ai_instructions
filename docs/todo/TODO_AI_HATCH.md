* dont' rely on `get_errors` tool after making significant changes. Intead compile the smallest scheme which includes the changes (package target first, then app if needed)

* compile package first, then app if needed
  * I told agent to compile to find error while working in a module. it compiled the app
    * `xcodebuild -workspace Nightlight.xcworkspace -scheme HatchIoTShadowClient -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=Any iOS Simulator Device'
 build 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "error:"`
```sh
xcodebuild -workspace Nightlight.xcworkspace -scheme HatchIoTShadowClient -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "error:"
```


# How to configure copilot to see what it's thinkign in real time?

# Avoid filtering output. Instead use Tee
xcodebuild -workspace Nightlight.xcworkspace -scheme HatchIoTShadowClient -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "error:"

or zome other approach where i can watch the output live
xcodebuild -workspace Nightlight.xcworkspace -scheme HatchIoTShadowClient -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "error:"

one per year we drop support for the oldest iOS version that is currenntly supported. That's currently `iOS 17.0`. We need to increment this to the next major version `iOS 18.0`

This change needs to be made in:


## Nightlight.xcodeproj

Project Settings (Nightlight.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)
![Xcode_project_settings](images/Xcode_project_settings.png)

Each target (Nightlight.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj) (there are 5 of them)
* this image shows one 1 of the 5
* Ideally the targets should fall back to the project setting. This is not how it is currently setup

## WalkingSkeletonApp.xcodeproj

Approach this in the same manner as `Nightlight.xcodeproj`


## Package.swift
