###  `slog_var1_se` 
* `slog_var1_se` - Help my update this function to support more variable types

Currently we have several individual functions to log variable details
```zsh
# works on primitive types (string, int, bool), but not collections
# bad: requires passing the name and the value
slog_var_se "my_var" "$my_var"

# works on standard arrays
# bad: requires passing the 2 args (name and the value(s))
# bad: only works on arrays (not associated arrays)
slog_array_se "my_array" "${my_array[@]}"
```

* when logging values, wrap them in single quotes (unless empty)
* when logging values, if value is nil, represent it with `<nil>` (without single quotes)
