This computer has the application /Applications/GrandPerspective.app installed which generates box plots that represent files on disk (in terms of disk usage).

I can't figure out how to launch this tool on command line so that it scans a particular directory. /Applications/GrandPerspective.app/Contents/MacOS/GrandPerspective "/Users/zakkhoyt/Documents/notes/shell" opens a window but no action
Are there other more modern apps/tools to do this? Anythign in homebrew?
what is this plot type called?
it looks like this app can read "scan data" files. What kind of format/standard is it expecting? What other apps can read/write that format?
```
